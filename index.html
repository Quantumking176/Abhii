    <p>To my sweetheart you make everything infinitely better, thank you for everything that you do for me.
I was yours
before I knew,
and you have always
been mine too.‚ù§Ô∏è
You are my best friend as well as my lover, and I do not know which side of you I enjoy the most. I treasure each side, just as I have treasured our life together.üíû
"I love you, not only for what you are but for what I am when I‚Äôm with you. I love you, not only for what you have made for yourself but for what you are making of me.‚Äù ‚ù£Ô∏è
"I choose you.
And I'll choose you over and over and over.
Without pause, without a doubt, in a heartbeat.
I'll keep choosing you."
I love you the most! ‚ù§Ô∏è
